Tata Data Analytics Virtual Internship 2025 – 

Task 1

📌 Task Objective
To perform data quality assessment and identify issues in the dataset such as:

Missing values
Inconsistent entries
Outlier detection
Basic statistical summaries
🛠️ Tools & Platform Used
GNI (Generative Natural Intelligence) platform
Prompt-based EDA
Dataset uploaded in CSV format


  Task 2
  
This repository contains my submission for Task 2 of the Tata Data Analytics Virtual Internship 2025, focused on predictive modeling using the Geldium dataset. This task builds on insights from Task 1 (EDA) and applies GenAI-powered methods to design a responsible and explainable credit risk model.

📌 Task Objective
To create a structured predictive modeling plan that helps identify customers at risk of delinquency, using AI/ML approaches supported by GenAI tools.

Key objectives included:

✅ Developing model logic for binary classification (delinquent or not)
✅ Selecting and justifying the appropriate model (Logistic Regression)
✅ Planning for model evaluation using industry-standard metrics
✅ Addressing ethical considerations: bias, fairness, and explainability
🛠️ Tools & Platform Used
GenAI tools like ChatGPT & Gemini (for logic generation and refinement)
Prompt-driven modeling approach
Microsoft Word – final plan drafted and formatted for submission
Dataset provided via GNI platform
🧠 GenAI Prompt Used
"Suggest a predictive modeling approach for credit delinquency using features like income, credit score, and missed payments. Explain model choice and evaluation metrics."



 Task 3
 
The report translates predictive model insights into a clear, actionable strategy for Geldium’s Head of Collections.

📝 Report Focus
Identify high-risk customer segments
Provide SMART, business-ready recommendations
Address fairness, explainability, and responsible AI use
📎 File: Task3_Business_Summary_Report_Formatted.docx

🤖 GenAI Prompt Used
“Create a 2-page business summary report for the Head of Collections using insights from EDA and predictive modeling. Identify at-risk segments, provide a SMART recommendation, and address ethical considerations like fairness and explainability using plain, professional language.”

🎯 Outcome
A structured, non-technical report connecting data insights with real-world decisions in financial services.



Task 4

📌 Task Objective
To design a framework for an AI-driven, autonomous debt management system using agentic AI to personalize and automate debt collections in real time, while ensuring compliance, fairness, and transparency.

Time to translate your recommendations into a high-level concept for an autonomous, responsible AI-powered collections system. You’ll present this as a PowerPoint deck, simulating a real executive briefing.

Your recommendations will build on the predictive model framework you outlined in Task 2 and your stakeholder recommendations from Task 3.

Now that you've identified at-risk customer segments and proposed targeted interventions, it’s time to design a system that can apply these insights at scale, while remaining fair, explainable, and compliant. This mirrors the kind of work many AI and analytics professionals are asked to do in real-world business environments: turning insight into sustainable automation.

In this task, you’ll create a PowerPoint that outlines your proposed AI-powered collections system. This isn’t a technical system architecture — it’s a high-level strategy describing:

How the system would work
What ethical and regulatory guardrails it needs
How its success would be measured
Step 1: Build Your PowerPoint Outline
Before diving into the details, start by planning your deck. Your PowerPoint should include the following slides:

Slide 1-2: How the system works (inputs, decision logic, actions, learning loop)
Slide 3: Role of agentic AI (autonomous vs. human-in-the-loop activities)
Slide 4: Responsible AI guardrails (fairness, explainability, compliance)
Slide 5: Expected business impact (quantitative and qualitative outcomes)
Use this outline to organize your ideas before building each individual slide. Feel free to include additional slides as needed to convey your ideas effectively!

Step 2: Build Your Slides
With the overall structure of your PowerPoint in place, it's time to start building out the individual slides. We've also included a PowerPoint template in the resources below for you to use to build out your presentation. Each slide includes built-in guidance in the slides and notes. Feel free to add additional slides or adapt the structure to suit your approach.

Slide 1-2. Describe how the system will work 
Describe the overall system workflow using simple bullet points or diagrams.

Action:  Create a simple 4-part list or diagram showing the flow from customer data to decision-making to action to learning.

Slide 3. Role of Agentic AI
Explain which parts of the system will operate autonomously and which require human oversight. 

Action:  Create a table with two columns ("Autonomous" vs. "Human Oversight") and list examples for each.

Slide 4: Responsible AI Guardrails
List key safeguards you would build into the system to ensure it operates fairly and responsibly.

Action:  Create a 3–4 bullet list of responsible AI guardrails you will build into the system.
